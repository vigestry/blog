## 🌐 Why does a researcher need a personal website?  

Today, for a student or researcher, it’s important not only to write papers and attend conferences but also to present oneself online. A personal website helps to:  
- 📑 collect all publications and projects in one place;  
- 🔗 share links to scholarly profiles (Google Scholar, eLibrary, ORCID, and others);  
- 💼 showcase professional skills and achievements;  
- 📬 connect with colleagues and potential employers.  

In short, your site becomes a personal portfolio available 24/7.
