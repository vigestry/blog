## 📖 What are scientific programming languages?  

Scientific programming languages are designed to solve problems in science, engineering, and data analysis.  
Their main purpose is to make it easier for researchers to perform computations, modeling, data processing, and result visualization.  

Unlike general-purpose languages, these tools often include built-in libraries for mathematics, statistics, and numerical methods.
