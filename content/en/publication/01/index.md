## 🔑 What is version control?  

Version control is a system that allows you to track changes in files and projects. It records each modification, noting who made it and when. This makes it easy to return to a previous state of the project, compare different versions, and monitor the development process.

## 🏗️ Why is it important?  

1. **Work safety**  
   If something goes wrong, you can always restore an earlier version of the project.  

2. **Collaboration**  
   Multiple people can work on the same project at the same time, and the system helps merge their changes into one unified version.  

3. **Development history**  
   At any moment, you can trace how the project evolved and understand the reasoning behind decisions.  

4. **Quality control**  
   A team lead can review changes before they are included in the main version of the project.
