## 📖 Why is proper report formatting important?  

A report is a document that records the results of work: laboratory, coursework, research, or practice.  
Its formatting reflects not only the content but also the author’s attitude towards the work. A clear structure makes reading easier, while neatness leaves a positive impression on the teacher or supervisor.

## ✍️ Tips for formatting  

- Use a consistent font and style throughout the document.  
- Headings should stand out (for example, numbering or bold text).
