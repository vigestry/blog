## ðŸ“Œ Week from July 9 to July 15

We visited several museums, which inspired reflections on how technology influences culture and education.  

Alongside the walks, I continued reading literature on business informatics â€” it turned out that many books provide a practical perspective on what will be studied in senior courses.
