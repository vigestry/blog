## ðŸ“Œ Week from July 2 to July 8  

The exams are behind me, and the holidays have finally begun! The first feeling is lightness and joy.  
I dedicated this week to rest: spent more time with friends, played football, and finally managed to read books peacefully without thinking about exams.  

I also enrolled in several online courses for self-development to keep up the learning rhythm during the summer.
