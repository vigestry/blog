## ðŸ“Œ Week from July 23 to July 29  

The holidays are gradually reaching their midpoint, and I felt the urge to engage in something more productive.  
I started working on a small project in Python for practice: planning to build a simple personal expense tracking app.  

In addition, I created a reading list and study materials to prepare for the next semester.  
It feels like summer is becoming not only a time for rest but also a launchpad for future ideas.
