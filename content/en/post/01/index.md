## ðŸ“Œ Week from June 25 to July 1  

The main topic of this week was the exam session. The atmosphere was tense but exciting: for the first time, I had to take several serious exams in a row.  
What stood out the most was preparing for the mathematics exam â€” I had to review my notes and solve dozens of problems.  

The Business Informatics exam turned out to be less difficult than expected: most questions focused on theory and examples of real-world applications in companies.  
It really feels like the first year of studies is reaching an important milestone.
